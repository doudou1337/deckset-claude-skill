# Footers and Slide Numbers

To add a persistent footer to each slide of your presentation, insert the following command at the _top_ of your file:

`footer: Your footer goes here`

To add running slide numbers to each slide of your presentation, insert the following command at the _top_ of your file:

`slidenumbers: true`

When combining the two commands, please make sure that there are _no empty lines_ between the two.
    
    
    footer: Your footer goes here
    slidenumbers: true
    

You can use standard text styles such as emphasis in your footer text, just as you would in other places too.

`footer: Use *emphasis* and ~~other~~ text styles if you like`

If you want to disable footers or slide numbers on individual slides, you can do so by using [per slide commands](../Customization/01-configuration-commands.html).
