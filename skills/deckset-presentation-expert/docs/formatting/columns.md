# Columns

In order to layout your content in columns, use the `[.column]` command to start a new column.
    
    
    [.column]
    
    # The First column
    
    [.column]
    
    # Second column.
    
    

Column widths are automatically generated using the available space divided evenly by the number of columns specified.

You can add as many columns as you like, but the more you add, the smaller the available width will be.

Combine Columns with [Auto-Scaling](https://docs.decksetapp.com/English.lproj/Formatting/13-auto-scaling.html) to automatically scale down the text size to fit on the side.
