    # Controlling Line Breaks
    
    In paragraph text, Deckset respects when you start a
    new

    This can come in handy in situations where you need more control over how text is broken up into multiple lines.

    # Use `<br>` for<br>line<br>breaks
    
    You can use the HTML tag `<br>` to insert line breaks in elements that cannot contain regular new lines, such as headings or footers.
