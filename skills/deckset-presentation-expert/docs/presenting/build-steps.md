# Build Steps

When presenting you often want list bullet points to appear one by one. To achieve this with Deckset, put

`build-lists: true`

at the top of your file.

If you want to disable this setting on individual slides, you can do so by using [per slide commands](../Customization/01-configuration-commands.html).
