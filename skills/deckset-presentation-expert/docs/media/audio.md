# Audio

To add audio files to your presentation, add them to your Markdown like so:
    
    
    ![](audio.mp3)
    

Your operating system’s file type icon will be used as a visual representation of the audio file.

## Audio Layout Control

Use the same layout modifiers as with images to control the positioning of audio file icons.

  * `left` and `right`
  * `fit` and `fill`
  * Percentage sizing, e.g. `25%`
  * `hide` to hide the visual representation. Audio will play regardless.

## Audio Playback Control

Control audio playback by using one of those directives:

  * `autoplay`
  * `loop`
  * `mute`
