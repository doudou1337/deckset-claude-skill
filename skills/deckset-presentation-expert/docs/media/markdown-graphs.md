# Markdown Graphs

You can add graphs to your presentation by leveraging code blocks and specifying mermaid as the desired language:
    
    
    ```mermaid
    pie showData
        title Key elements in Product X
        "Calcium" : 42.96
        "Potassium" : 50.05
        "Magnesium" : 10.01
        "Iron" :  5
    ```
    

You can also use customization menu to specify base colors for Mermaid graphs:
