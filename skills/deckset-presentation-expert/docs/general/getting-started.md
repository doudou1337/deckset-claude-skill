# Getting Started

Deckset is a presentation software that creates great-looking slides from simple Markdown files.

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a simple syntax to format plain text. It allows you to create structured documents with just a few modifiers. Here’s an example:
    
    
    # Headline indicates a first level title.
    
    ## Subheader a second level title.
    

## Separating Slides

To start a new slide, simply put three dashes (`---`) on a single line, with an empty line above and below.

## Use Headings
    
    
    # Use Headings
    
    Combine headings with paragraph text and other elements like lists:
    
    - It's super quick.
    - It's super easy.

## Paragraphs
    
    
    # Paragraphs
    
    Use a blank line in between text to start a new paragraph.
    
    You can include a paragraph break by leaving an empty line between the paragraphs.
    Otherwise lines will follow on directly like this.
