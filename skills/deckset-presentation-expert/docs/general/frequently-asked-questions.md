# Frequently Asked Questions  
  
## Do I need to know how to code?

No, you definitely don’t need to be a coder. Markdown is a very simple way of formatting text, which is used by millions of people without knowing how to code. We think you’ll be able to jump straight in, but if you want to familiarise yourself a little bit more and have ten minutes to spare, [here’s a great intro to Markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/).

## Can I tweak or re-order my slides in Deckset?

No. Deckset formats and presents your files. You can easily alter them in your Markdown file. You work directly in text. Deckset does the rest for you.

## Why does Deckset for macOS not have a built-in editor?

It doesn’t need one — there are plenty of great text editors out there, and everybody has their favourite anyway. We want you to be able to work with what you’re used to and what you enjoy the most.

## What editors work well with Deckset?

We personally use Atom, Sublime Text, TextMate, Chocolat, Mou and Writer Pro. Those are great. But others are great too. You can choose whatever editor you like. All you need is a Markdown text file.

## Can Deckset highlight my code?

Yes! Simply wrap your code in three backticks (```). To add syntax highlighting, just add an optional language identifier. For example, to syntax-highlight Javascript code:
    
    
    function myFunction(){
        alert(“Hello World!”)
    };
    

See [here](https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js/tree/master/src/languages) for a complete list of all languages that are supported.

## What’s the best way to work with images in Deckset?

We recommend you use web images in your presentations. You can simply paste the image’s URL into the standard Markdown syntax, or even easier, drag the image from the web onto the Deckset window. The Markdown is automatically created and copied to your clipboard.

Images from the web will be downloaded to your computer and cached locally, so you don’t have to worry about having an Internet connection when you present.

Using web images comes with one big advantage — you can easily share your files (your deck!) with other people, without having to worry about sending them the images as well.

Tools like Dropbox or other storage services are easy ways to bring your local images to the web and guarantee a smooth workflow with Deckset.
