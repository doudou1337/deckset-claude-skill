    At times you have to fit more content onto one slide than the default font sizes allow for.
    
    Deckset comes with an option to auto-scale paragraph text, lists, and other body content down to fit onto the slide. To enable this behavior put
    
    `autoscale: true`
    
    on the first line of your markdown file.
